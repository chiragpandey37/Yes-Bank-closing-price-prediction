# Yes Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the **closing price of Yes Bank's stock** using **regression models**. Stock market prices are highly volatile, and machine learning models can help identify trends and patterns for better decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** (Specify source, e.g., Yahoo Finance, NSE, Kaggle)
- **Features:**
  - `Date` – Trading date
  - `Open` – Opening price
  - `High` – Highest price during trading
  - `Low` – Lowest price during trading
  - `Close` – Closing price (Target variable)

## 🛠 Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values** – Used interpolation or dropped missing records
- **Feature Engineering** – Added moving averages, volatility, etc.
- **Scaling** – Applied MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualized stock price trends over time** 📉
- **Correlation analysis** to check feature relationships 🔗
- **Moving averages & volatility analysis**
